# Computer-Vision


The vision systems are pretty much the same for humans, animals, insects, and most living organisms.

They consists of a sensors or an eye to capture the image and a brain to process and interpret the image. The system then outputs a prediction of the image components based on the data extracted from the image.

Suppose we want to interpret the image of dogs as shown in the figure below. We look at it and directly understand that the image consists of a bunch of dogs. It comes pretty naturally to
us to classify and detect objects in the image because we have been trained over the years to identify dogs.

As if someone shows you a picture of a dog for the first time - You definitely donâ€™t know what is in the picture. Then they tell you that this is a dog. After a couple of experiments like this, you will have been trained to identify dogs. Similarly, you are trained to identify different objects and learn their different features.
